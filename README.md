Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
 * Flutter SDK: Install Flutter
 * Dart SDK: (Comes with Flutter)
 * Git: Install Git
 * IDE: Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart plugins, or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins.
 * A backend for your data: (e.g., Firebase, Node.js with Express, PHP with Laravel, etc.) - Specify your backend technology here.
   * If using Firebase: Ensure you have a Firebase project set up and have configured your google-services.json (Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) files.
   * If using a custom backend: Ensure your backend server is running and accessible.
Installation
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/baby-shop-hub.git
cd baby-shop-hub

 * Install dependencies:
   flutter pub get

 * Configure your backend:
   * For Firebase:
     * Place your google-services.json file in android/app/.
     * Place your GoogleService-Info.plist file in ios/Runner/.
     * Ensure your Firebase project is properly set up with Firestore, Authentication, Storage (if used for images), etc.
   * For Custom Backend:
     * You might need to update API endpoints in your code (e.g., lib/constants/api_constants.dart or similar).
 * Set up environment variables (if applicable):
   * You might have sensitive API keys or URLs that should not be committed directly to Git. Consider using flutter_dotenv or similar packages.
Running the App
 * Connect a device or start an emulator:
   flutter devices

 * Run the application:
   flutter run

   This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator. By default, it will likely open the user app. You may need to navigate to the admin section based on your app's navigation logic (e.g., specific login credentials for admin, or a separate entry point in your code for development).
